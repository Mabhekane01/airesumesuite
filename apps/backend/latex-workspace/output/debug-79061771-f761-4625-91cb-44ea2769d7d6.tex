\NewPart{Achievements and Interests}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] Dropped out of University Club summer 2021 as the team lead. \squigarr Don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't accept something just because you can. 
    \item[\heartstab] Didn't complete the 2021 DEFG international math competition final round because of self-esteem issues. \squigarr Don't be scared of losing at stuff. Nothing ever comes out of self pity.
    \item[\heartstab] Never applied to University entrance scholarship \squigarr this would have been good to have, as a credential, and for money, even though the fees are not too dear here it's still easy money. 
    \item[\heartstab] I haven't played any music in years \squigarr sometimes you need to make sacrifices to get what you want. You can't have everything you want at the same time. Though sad I think it was a good decision.
