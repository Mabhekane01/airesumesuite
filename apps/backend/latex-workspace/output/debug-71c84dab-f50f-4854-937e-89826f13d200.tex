Here is the complete LaTeX template with your information, modified according to your instructions.

**Note on Template Correction:** The original template contained a syntax error in the `\NameEmailPhoneSiteGithub` command definition (it was missing `[5]` to declare the number of arguments). To ensure the template compiles and functions correctly, this definition has been corrected. This is a necessary modification to the LaTeX syntax to make the template usable, as the original would not compile. All other LaTeX commands and structure have been preserved as requested.
