\NewPart{Education}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\heartsuit$] \textbf{BSc from North-West University:} Graduated with a GPA of 65, but did not formally specify the location or exact graduation date on my CV.
    \item[$\rightsquigarrow$] Overlooked the importance of including precise details and location, which can hinder a complete understanding of my academic background.
\end{itemize}

\NewPart{Work Experiance}{} % Kept original typo for template fidelity

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\heartsuit$] \textbf{Network Engineer \& Software Developer at CMC Networks (2023-07-01 to Present):} Despite engineering and maintaining real-time monitoring systems, encountered unexpected outages that highlighted gaps in predictive analytics.
    \item[$\rightsquigarrow$] Learned the necessity of proactive anomaly detection and continuous refinement of monitoring thresholds to prevent recurrence, rather than just reacting to failures.
    \item[$\heartsuit$] Faced challenges integrating diverse legacy service platforms (Fresh Services, PRTG, inventory systems), where initial estimates for data migration and API standardization proved optimistic.
    \item[$\rightsquigarrow$] Understood the critical importance of thorough initial discovery phases and realistic timeline setting for complex enterprise integrations, acknowledging technical debt in older systems.
    \item[$\heartsuit$] While automating reporting dashboards and building data lake architecture, found that some stakeholders preferred ad-hoc, customized reports over standardized dashboards, leading to initial resistance.
    \item[$\rightsquigarrow$] Realized that technological solutions must be accompanied by strong stakeholder engagement and change management to ensure adoption and maximize impact across the organization.
\end{itemize}

%%% Skills
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
\NewPart{Skills}{}

\SkillsEntry{Java}{Initially struggled with Java's verbosity and extensive boilerplate, which slowed down early development efforts and made rapid prototyping challenging.}
\SkillsEntry{C\#}{Had a steep learning curve adapting to C\# and the .NET ecosystem specifics, particularly with asynchronous programming patterns and dependency injection frameworks, coming from other languages.}
\SkillsEntry{Node.js}{Experienced difficulties debugging complex asynchronous flows in Node.js, leading to frustrating race conditions and hard-to-trace bugs in early projects before mastering promises and async/await.}
\SkillsEntry{React}{Found it difficult to manage state effectively in large-scale React applications without adopting a consistent and robust state management strategy from the outset, leading to prop drilling issues.}
\SkillsEntry{MongoDB}{Misunderstood optimal data modeling practices for MongoDB, resulting in less efficient queries and significant data redundancy in an early NoSQL database design for a project.}
\SkillsEntry{Git}{Made critical mistakes with Git rebase operations and complex branching strategies in collaborative projects, causing conflicts and occasional loss of work due to insufficient understanding of advanced features.}
\SkillsEntry{Docker}{Initially overcomplicated Docker setups, leading to bloated images and inefficient build processes before grasping multi-stage builds and best practices for container optimization.}
\SkillsEntry{TypeScript}{Struggled with the initial overhead of TypeScript type definitions and sometimes wrote overly strict or incorrect types that hindered rapid prototyping and refactoring in fast-paced environments.}

%%% Achievements and Interests
%%% -----------------------------------------------------------

\NewPart{Achievements and Interests}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\heartsuit$] \textbf{SocialStream - Integrated Social Media Platform:} While architecting a complex microservices backend, I initially struggled with the sheer number of moving parts and inter-service communication overhead, leading to slower development cycles than planned.
    \item[$\rightsquigarrow$] Realized the importance of thorough planning for distributed systems, strong API contracts, and robust observability tools to manage complexity and identify bottlenecks efficiently from the project's inception.
    \item[$\heartsuit$] During the implementation of real-time messaging and video/voice calling, faced significant performance issues with scaling WebRTC and Socket.io beyond a small user base due to underestimated infrastructure requirements and a lack of prior experience with real-time scaling.
    \item[$\rightsquigarrow$] Learned that scaling real-time systems requires specialized knowledge in network protocols, load balancing, and efficient server-side processing, often necessitating a dedicated focus on these areas early in the design phase.
    \item[$\heartsuit$] The content recommendation algorithms and rating systems were less effective than anticipated initially because of insufficient diverse training data and edge cases in user interaction patterns that were not accounted for in the first iteration.
    \item[$\rightsquigarrow$] Understood that data quality and comprehensive data collection are paramount for the success of machine learning features, and iterative refinement based on continuous user feedback and diverse datasets is essential for improving algorithm performance.
\end{itemize}
