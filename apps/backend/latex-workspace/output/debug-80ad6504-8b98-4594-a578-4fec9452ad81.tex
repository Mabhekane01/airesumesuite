\NewPart{Key}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] Heart-stab. Professional rejections and things I messed up.
    \item[\squigarr] Squigly arrow. What did I learn? What were the consequences?
\end{itemize}

\NewPart{Education}{}

% Jesse said to make a hybrid of bothe CV's, so more bullet-points but also need adequate description
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] \textbf{North-West University:} While I successfully completed my BSc in Field of Study, I initially underestimated the rigor of academic life, leading to moments of intense pressure and self-doubt.
    \item[\squigarr] This experience taught me invaluable lessons in perseverance, time management, and the importance of seeking support when needed.
\end{itemize}

\NewPart{Work Experiance}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] \textbf{CMC Networks (2023-07-01 - Present):} As a Network Engineer \& Software Developer, I faced the significant challenge of engineering and maintaining real-time monitoring systems, where achieving 99.9\% uptime across critical infrastructure demanded constant vigilance and problem-solving.
    \item[\squigarr] This role honed my ability to perform under pressure, meticulously troubleshoot complex systems, and continuously optimize for reliability, even when facing unforeseen technical hurdles.

\NewPart{Skills}{}

\SkillsEntry{Java}{Despite proficiency, I initially struggled with Java's verbose syntax and object-oriented paradigms, requiring significant effort to master.}
\SkillsEntry{C\#}{My journey with C\# involved overcoming initial difficulties with its .NET ecosystem and asynchronous programming models.}
\SkillsEntry{Node.js}{I faced challenges in fully grasping Node.js's non-blocking I/O model and callback hell before adopting async/await.}
\SkillsEntry{React.js}{Learning React.js involved a steep curve in understanding component lifecycle and state management, leading to frustrating debugging sessions.}
\SkillsEntry{MongoDB}{Initially, I found MongoDB's schema-less nature challenging to manage for complex data relationships, requiring a shift in my database design mindset.}

%%% Achievements
%%% -----------------------------------------------------------

\NewPart{Achievements and Interests}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] Dropped out of University Club summer 2021 as the team lead. \squigarr Don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't accept something just because you can. 
    \item[\heartstab] Didn't complete the 2021 DEFG international math competition final round because of self-esteem issues. \squigarr Don't be scared of losing at stuff. Nothing ever comes out of self pity.
    \item[\heartstab] Never applied to University entrance scholarship \squigarr this would have been good to have, as a credential, and for money, even though the fees are not too dear here it's still easy money. 
    \item[\heartstab] I haven't played any music in years \squigarr sometimes you need to make sacrifices to get what you want. You can't have everything you want at the same time. Though sad I think it was a good decision.
