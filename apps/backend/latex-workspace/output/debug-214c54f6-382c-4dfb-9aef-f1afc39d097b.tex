%%% Education

\NewPart{Key}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] Heart-stab. Professional rejections and things I messed up.
    \item[\squigarr] Squigly arrow. What did I learn? What were the consequences?
\end{itemize}

\NewPart{Education}{}

% Jesse said to make a hybrid of bothe CV's, so more bullet-points but also need adequate description
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] During my BSc at North-West University, I struggled significantly with a core programming module, almost failing it. \squigarr This forced me to dedicate extra time and seek help, ultimately strengthening my foundational understanding of software development.
\end{itemize}

%%% Work experience
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
\NewPart{Work Experiance}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] Early in my role as Network Engineer at CMC Networks, I overlooked a critical configuration detail, leading to a brief service interruption. \squigarr This taught me the absolute necessity of meticulous pre-deployment checks and peer reviews.
    \item[\heartstab] My first attempt at automating a routine network task using a script had a bug that caused an incorrect data entry. \squigarr I learned the hard way about robust error handling and thorough testing in automation.
    \item[\heartstab] I initially underestimated the complexity of integrating a new monitoring tool, leading to project delays. \squigarr This experience highlighted the importance of detailed planning and realistic scope assessment for new technologies.
\end{itemize}

%%% Skills
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
\NewPart{Skills}{}

\SkillsEntry{Java}{I still find myself struggling with advanced Java concurrency patterns and memory management in large applications.}
\SkillsEntry{C\#}{My experience with C\# is primarily theoretical; I haven't had the opportunity to build many large-scale production applications with it.}
\SkillsEntry{Node.js}{I often spend too much time debugging asynchronous code and callback hell issues in complex Node.js applications.}
\SkillsEntry{React.js}{I sometimes over-engineer React components, making them more complex and harder to maintain than necessary.}
\SkillsEntry{MongoDB}{I'm still learning to optimize complex MongoDB queries and schema designs for very large datasets and high-performance scenarios.}

%%% Achievements
%%% -----------------------------------------------------------

\NewPart{Achievements and Interests}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] Dropped out of University Club summer 2021 as the team lead. \squigarr Don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't accept something just because you can. 
    \item[\heartstab] Didn't complete the 2021 DEFG international math competition final round because of self-esteem issues. \squigarr Don't be scared of losing at stuff. Nothing ever comes out of self pity.
    \item[\heartstab] Never applied to University entrance scholarship \squigarr this would have been good to have, as a credential, and for money, even though the fees are not too dear here it's still easy money. 
    \item[\heartstab] I haven't played any music in years \squigarr sometimes you need to make sacrifices to get what you want. You can't have everything you want at the same time. Though sad I think it was a good decision.
