\textbf{Network Engineer & Software Developer} \hfill \textbf{CMC Networks}
Building H, The Woodlands, Office Park, 20 Woodlands Dr, Woodmead, Sandton, 2191 \hfill July 2023 -- Present
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Engineered and maintained real-time monitoring systems achieving 99.9\% uptime across critical infrastructure using Python and monitoring tools.
    \item Developed automated reporting dashboards reducing manual report generation time by 60\% through data integration and visualization.
    \item Collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement security policies and anomaly detection systems, strengthening network perimeter defense.
    \item Led incident response and root cause analysis for critical system failures, documenting solutions and implementing preventive measures.
    \item Built centralized Data Lake architecture streamlining performance metrics collection and analysis across multiple systems.
    \item Integrated multiple service platforms (Fresh Services, PRTG, inventory systems) enabling real-time asset visibility and management.
    \item[\texttimes] Faced initial resistance when proposing new automation tools to established teams, leading to slower adoption rates for some solutions.
    \item[$\rightarrow$] Learned the critical importance of stakeholder engagement and demonstrating immediate, tangible value through pilot projects, which later accelerated adoption and buy-in.

\NewPart{Skills}{}

\SkillsEntry{Java}{Initially found object-oriented concepts challenging, slowing down early project development, but overcame with persistent practice.}
\SkillsEntry{C\#}{Transitioning from other languages, struggled with C#'s specific async/await patterns until practical application solidified understanding.}
\SkillsEntry{Node.js}{Early projects suffered from 'callback hell'; improved by adopting Promises/async-await and better code structuring.}
\SkillsEntry{React}{Felt overwhelmed by the vast ecosystem and frequent updates; focused on core concepts and practical application to master it.}
\SkillsEntry{MongoDB}{Misunderstood indexing strategies in initial NoSQL applications, leading to performance bottlenecks.}
\SkillsEntry{Git}{Early on, frequently encountered merge conflicts and lost work due to insufficient understanding of advanced branching strategies.}
\SkillsEntry{Docker}{Initial deployments were difficult due to misconfigured networking and volumes; learned best practices through iterative refinement.}
\SkillsEntry{TypeScript}{Reluctance to adopt strong typing initially slowed down learning, but eventually appreciated its benefits for large-scale projects.}
