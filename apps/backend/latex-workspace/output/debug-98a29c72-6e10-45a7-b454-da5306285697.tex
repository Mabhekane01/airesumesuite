\NewPart{Key}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] Heart-stab. Professional rejections and things I messed up.
    \item[\squigarr] Squigly arrow. What did I learn? What were the consequences?
\end{itemize}

\NewPart{Education}{}

% Jesse said to make a hybrid of bothe CV's, so more bullet-points but also need adequate description
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] During my BSc in Field of Study from North-West University (Graduation Date), I initially focused too heavily on theoretical concepts, neglecting practical application and hands-on coding.
    \item[\squigarr] This oversight made early projects challenging, but it taught me the critical importance of balancing academic rigor with practical implementation, a skill now vital for bridging infrastructure and software.
\end{itemize}

%%% Work experience
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
\NewPart{Work Experiance}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] As a Network Engineer \& Software Developer at CMC Networks (2023-07-01 - Present), I initially struggled with integrating legacy network systems with modern software solutions.
    \item[\squigarr] This challenge highlighted the need for thorough system analysis and flexible API design, leading to the successful engineering of real-time monitoring systems achieving 99.9\% uptime.
    \item[\heartstab] Despite achieving 99.9\% uptime, a critical incident occurred due to an unforeseen edge case in the monitoring infrastructure.
    \item[\squigarr] This taught me the importance of continuous stress testing and proactive incident response planning, pushing me to refine system resilience beyond initial expectations.
\end{itemize}

%%% Skills
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
\NewPart{Skills}{}

\SkillsEntry{Java}{Initially found Java's verbosity and strict typing challenging, preferring more dynamic languages.}
\SkillsEntry{C\#}{Struggled with C\# and the .NET ecosystem's learning curve, especially coming from other platforms.}
\SkillsEntry{Node.js}{Took time to fully grasp asynchronous programming patterns and callback hell in Node.js.}
\SkillsEntry{React.js}{Initially found React's component lifecycle and state management complex to master.}
\SkillsEntry{MongoDB}{Struggled with the paradigm shift from relational databases to NoSQL document models like MongoDB.}

%%% Achievements

\NewPart{Achievements and Interests}{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\heartstab] Dropped out of University Club summer 2021 as the team lead. \squigarr Don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't accept something just because you can. 
    \item[\heartstab] Didn't complete the 2021 DEFG international math competition final round because of self-esteem issues. \squigarr Don't be scared of losing at stuff. Nothing ever comes out of self pity.
    \item[\heartstab] Never applied to University entrance scholarship \squigarr this would have been good to have, as a credential, and for money, even though the fees are not too dear here it's still easy money. 
    \item[\heartstab] I haven't played any music in years \squigarr sometimes you need to make sacrifices to get what you want. You can't have everything you want at the same time. Though sad I think it was a good decision.
